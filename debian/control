Description: Perl module to detect memory cycles in Perl objects
 Devel::Cycle is a developer's tool for finding memory cycles in Perl objects.
 Since Perl provides its automatic memory management using reference counting,
 cyclical/circular references will result in memory that will never be freed.
 Optionally, PadWalker (libpadwalker-perl) module enables reporting of cycles
 in code closures as well.
